<h3 align='center'>Fetching HOD by using variables in query</h3>

- First we use Simple Frappe query "frappe.db.get_value('User', 'hodcse@gmail.com', 'full_name')".
- But this depends upon the email of hod if email will change in future then we need to change it.
- Also we have to wrote this many times.
- So we use another optimized version of query.
<br>

```py
department = self.department
requiredRole = "Hod" 
		
		self.hod = frappe.db.sql(f""" select full_name 
			from `tabUser` 
			where `email` IN (select user 
			from `tabUser Permission` 
			where `for_value`="{department}" AND `user` IN (select parent 
			from `tabHas Role` 
			where `role`="{requiredRole}" )) """)
```

- By using this query with variable we are able to use this for all departments.
